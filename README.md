Making an app to track my D&amp;D player

When completed this app will: 

    Allow user to login and logout using passport/bcrypt
  
    Allow user to add items/weapons/spells to current inventory for quick find uses.
  
    Allow user to update background.
  
Where I'd like to take this app:

    I would like to be able to host and give mobile responsiveness
  
    Allow the creation of new charaters and display all current characters for users
  
    Refresh UI with transitions/animations/ and give user ability to change colors. 
  
Why I am making this app:

    I would like a place where I can add details about my character and be able to update on a SPA so that I can quickly 
    and easily find what I am looking for. 
  
    I would like to see this app become more mobile responsive so I can use it while out, making use of bootstrap or materialize.
  
    This will also be a place where I can test new technologies so I will update an about page to list revisions .
